Procedure:

Step-1: Download diptrace trial version

Note: You need to download 30 days trial version as we have 500 pins in schematic. (And also you won't need it after 2-3 days.. because you guyz are software people)
 
Step-2: Open "Final_PCB_Schematic.dch". 

Note: for header pin number refer "Pin_layout.docx". (This information should be adequate). I have given each module name in schematic. 

Ask me if you don't get it.. Do not message on slack I hate that whatsapp or calls or in person.

If you guyz find any mistake in connection 
 
first step : Check again may be you got confused.
Second step : Open "Fault.docx" and write it in that.

Do not try to be oversmart and do not do any changes in "Final_PCB_Schematic.dch".

Thank you for your time. (Anyways after all you will be benifited by this - A grade in this subject).
